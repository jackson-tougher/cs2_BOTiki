# BOTiki 
This plugin adds bots to your server depending on the number of players, currently the plugin scheme is as follows:
* when there is one player, the plugin adds a bot
* when there are two players, the bot kicks and, if necessary, equalizes the players (1 T and 1 CT)
* when there are three players, the bot adds to the team where there is one player
* when there are more than three players, bots are removed altogether
